## Introduction
* Disabled people have lost their ability to movement, but every person have what make him/her special as disabled people also have special talents and thoughts which could benefit the society.
 From this point the idea of Fursaa came, because integrating them in the society it’s all of our responsibility.

## So What Is Fursaa
* A Syrian community pioneer project aimed to providing an opportunity for people with disabilities by developing devices to control the electric wheelchair they used by head movement.


<br>

## Our Objectives
* Providing the possibility to move independently for the people who can’t move their limbs.
* Seeking to help disabled people to use the talents they have, which bring benefits to them and their societies and breaks the barrier between them and creativity.
* While there is no such device in Syria, we aimed to make it available for all who need it, especially after the war in Syria which caused a lot of injuries and disability.
